Diagram Application
===================

Create various types of diagrams using [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/).

This is a simple application created using [AppWithinMinutes](http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/App+Within+Minutes+Application) and integrating [jgraph/draw.io](https://github.com/jgraph/draw.io/). It supports both editing and viewing diagrams. Each diagram is stored in a wiki page. It doesn't require any external services in order to work properly.
